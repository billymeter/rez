# Update 30 October 2021
Updates are few and far in between, and I'm sorry. I've been very busy with life. However, I found a flaw in the way the OPZ gives status when performing a firmware upgrade. Using this flaw, I have worked with another individual and decrypted the firmware.

# Update 08 November 2020
This project was put on hold due to personal reasons. I'm happy to give an update to say I'm working on this project again, and I've made a pretty significant finding. I'm not ready to show what I've found yet, but please expect another update soon. I'm only putting this message here to let you know this project is not dead. Thanks for your interest.
